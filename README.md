Project to help small companies an startups get rid of useless license fees and costs for overpriced shitware. 

I am starting with python and maybe will translate to C for the compile and runtime. But most hardware, even slackware should be able to run simple python code.

License for all in here is 3-clause-BSD license. Please, if you take the code here and repackage it nicely and make profit, consider donating. If you do you will have my gratitude. 
If not, you will still have my gratitude as long as you make the software side of startups cheaper. 

If you appreciate this or want me to spend more time updating and adding more, please say so. Motivation for free labour is not easy to find during these hard times. 

DEPENDENCIES SO FAR: pymsgbox tkinter

To do: 
  First time setup for the inventory software, make it ask user for amount of columns   and the name of the columns. 
  Fix ease of use things, make it give more feedback. For example adding an item should inject it at the top. Atm nothing happens and user can't tell if it worked or not.
  
  Auto invoice generation script.
