Project to help small companies an startups get rid of useless license fees and costs for overpriced shitware. 

I am starting with python and maybe will translate to C for the compile and runtime. But most hardware, even slackware should be able to run simple python code.

License for all in here is 3-clause-BSD license. Please, if you take the code here and repackage it nicely and make profit, consider donating. If you do you will have my gratitude. 
If not, you will still have my gratitude as long as you make the software side of startups cheaper. 

If you appreciate this or want me to spend more time updating and adding more, please say so. Motivation for free labour is not easy to find during these hard times.
