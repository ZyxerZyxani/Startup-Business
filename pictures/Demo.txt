Demo images to demonstrate. Mock database created with 26 mock entries. 
You get bild1.png if you click on search and all input boxes are empty. Also when you start the software. 

bild2.png is the result of clicking on the right arrow. E.g. it goes to page two. 

search.png shows an example of a search query, you can fill in all input fields and it will filter on all. search2.png is secondary example.

remove1.png is example for how to remove an entry. remove2.png is after you click remove (Ta Bort).

bild7.png shows error window. If anything goes wrong with the database, in this example it's trying to add a primary key (number) that already exists.
That makes the database throw an error. Every error message has qualified guess on what the error is, however, they will also have the exact error the database returned.
